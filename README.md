# YANA - Yet Another NES Assembler

This is pretty much NESASM, but only supports mapper 0 - so not even as good. But I wrote it and I know how it works. ;)
I will continue developing this for as long as it is fun, and hopefully surpass NESASM in functionality while doing so.

Tested on OSX, should compile on Linux using Clang++ 3.4+ (that's what I use for Travis).

## To build

`make`

## To test

`make test`

Runs a number of assemblies and compares the binary output with that of NESASM3.
